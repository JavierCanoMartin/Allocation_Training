# Allocation_Training
Supportive documents and files to install and test the Cambodia Deforestation Risk Map Tool

TRAINING OF TRAINERS– JULY 2021
DEFORESTATION RISK MAP METHODOLOGY AND TOOL

BACKGROUND:
Cambodia has initiated a strategy for “nesting” or integrating smaller-scale activities into national (or subnational) programs. To support this process, a Forest Reference Level (FRL) allocation tool was developed that can be used to identify maximum mitigation potential for any given area using a risk-based allocation method. 
The allocation tool is intended to ensure that project baselines, in aggregate, do not exceed (and ideally only comprise a “fair share” of) the national reference level, ensuring that both REDD+ results and benefits may also be shared at multiple scales.
Over the last year, Cambodia has accomplished the following efforts to develop a “nested” system:
-	Developed a revised FRL and submitted to UNFCCC for technical assessment.
-	Developed an allocation methodology for the FRL.
-	Drafted a regulatory framework for “nesting” REDD+ projects into a national system.

OBJECTIVES:
This training session will disclose and share with all stakeholders in deep details about general principles and technical procedures followed to develop the Deforestation Risk Map Methodology and Tool. Specifically, the training aims to:
1.	Gather technical feedback from participants to improve the methodology and the tool.
2.	Implement, in a collaborative effort between government officers, stakeholders and technical consultants, the agreed improvements.
3.	Document the whole process in order the create a dissemination paper to enhance transparency and robustness of the updated Risk Map Methodology and Tool.

METHODOLOGY:
The training will follow a collaborative development method divided in three steps:
1.	Creation of a common understanding and common rules.
2.	Individual analysis of current method and improvement proposals.
3.	Consensus agreement between all participants and implementation of improvements.
From the start of the workshop a GitHub Repository will be created to host the documentation, develop the code, and facilitate the collaborative work.

PROPOSED AGENDA:
The training will be held in three sessions in July 2021, via virtual meetings (zoom calls/meetings):

•	July 8th, Risk Map Methodology and Tool presentation. 4 hours (2 sessions)
During the first session, Javier Cano (UNDP Consultant) will present the general principles and technical procedures followed to develop the methodology and tool. 
All supportive documents and files to install and test the Tool will be shared with stakeholder in other to create a common understanding.
Disclaimer: The Data that will be shared is modified from the official data

•	July 9th – 14th, Individual assessment. 
During the week between initial and second meeting, participants are encouraged to analyse in detail the tool and methodology to identify potential findings and improvements.
It is suggested to participants, to share the findings and proposals with the working group using the systems prepared by the organization.
 

•	July 15th, Improvement Options. 4 hours (2 sessions)
During the second session, stakeholders will present the potential findings identified and the improvement proposals during the individual analysis. 
All proposals will be discussed in a round table to reach an agreement of improvements to be implemented and to define the arrangements to run the process.

•	July 16th – 28th, agreed improvements and procedures implementation.
During the period between the second and third working group meetings, the improvements and procedures previously agreed will be implemented. 
The upgrades will be executed following the specific arrangements established by the participants and overseed by the RTS responsible officers (i.e. Chivin Leng – MoE; Carlos Riaño RTS; and Javier Cano – UNDP Consultant).
The collaborative work will be done using the systems and procedures established by the workshop organization, whose is responsible for document the full process.
 
•	July 29th, Final presentation. 4 hours (2 sessions)
Once the improvements are implemented, a final session will be held to describe all procedures followed.
This session includes a training for the final user´s (specially government officers). 

PARTICIPANTS:
The target audience are technicians with robust experience on GIS/remote sensing experts with strong background in statistics:
1.	Technicians’ government officers from the MRV team:
2.	Technicians from NGOS and project developers (one per organization).
